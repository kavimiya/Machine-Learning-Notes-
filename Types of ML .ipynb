    "## Supervised Learning: \n",
    "* In supervised learning, the `algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset`, where each example in `the dataset is paired with a label or an outcome`. The `algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on this labeled data`. Common tasks in supervised learning include `classification (predicting categories)` and `regression (predicting continuous values)`.\n",
    "* Examples include spam email detection, image classification, and house price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning: \n",
    "* Unsupervised learning `involves training the algorithm on a dataset without labeled responses`. The algorithm `learns to find patterns or structures in the data on its own.` This `type of learning is useful for tasks such as clustering (grouping similar data points together)` and `dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features while preserving meaningful information)`.\n",
    "* Examples include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semi-Supervised Learning: \n",
    "* This type of learning `falls between supervised and unsupervised learning`. In semi-supervised learning, the `algorithm is trained on a dataset that is partially labeled - meaning, a small portion of the data has labels, while the majority of it does not`. This approach leverages the large amounts of unlabeled data to better understand the structure of the dataset and make predictions about the labels for the unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful when obtaining labels is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "* It's used in scenarios like image and speech recognition, where labeling requires expert human intervention and unlabeled data is abundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning: \n",
    "* In reinforcement learning, an `agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment`. The `agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its goal is to learn the optimal behavior to maximize cumulative rewards over time`.\n",
    "* Reinforcement learning is commonly used in tasks such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicle control.\n",
